When you open my code, the first and foremost thing that you should check is my "logo-and-links.css" file, the purpose of me to make that file is that to make every link asset on every page and every "logo + name" (top left corner_ asset on every page appear how I want. The file is shared throughout every .html file.

I made the css file separately and not grouped together because putting things together will make the file very big and hard to read. Therefore, for every html file, I stick with it a css file for stylings and many other related things. 

I did a lot of hover stuffs for this assignment because I found it cool. They're mostly in the "aboutme" webpage and the "projects" webpage. However, I like the hover thing mostly with the URL that I put at the bottom of the page, it's really nice there. 

CSS REQUIREMENTS: 
- flexboxes: aboutme.css and projects.css files
- grid: index.css files
- grid areas: interests.css files
- navigation: I believe that I style this everywhere, but mostly it is inside the interests.css file along with the interests.html
- 3 images: inside interests.css to display interests.html how I wanted it to be.
- URLS with hover: logo-and-links.css
- List styling: aboutme.css along with aboutme.html
- Table: interests.css 
- Style at least 1 page with flexboxes: I believed I've used flexbox for 2-3 pages.
- Style at least 1 page with grids: index.css

- Universal Selector: interests.css line 7
