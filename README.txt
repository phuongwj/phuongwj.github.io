When you open my code, the first and foremost thing that you should check is my "logo-and-links.css" file, the purpose of me to make that file is that to make every link asset on every page and every "logo + name" (top left corner_ asset on every page appear how I want. The file is shared throughout every .html file.

I made the css file separately and not grouped together because putting things together will make the file very big and hard to read. Therefore, for every html file, I stick with it a css file for stylings and many other related things. 

I did a lot of hover stuffs for this assignment because I found it cool. They're mostly in the "aboutme" webpage and the "projects" webpage. However, I like the hover thing mostly with the URL that I put at the bottom of the page, it's really nice there. 

Part 1: I have added media queries to all of the web pages and I believe that they are all dynamically serve and accessible.

Part 2:
- Notifications: Inside every single of my web pages, whenever you click the github to follow the link, you will receive a notification if you want to go to the external link or stay on the same page.
- Event Handler: I have event handler almost in every javascipt files I believe but for the implementation to be separate, if you click on my bed emoji inside my index.hml file, it will play a sound :)
- Conditional: There is a easteregg.js file embedded for you to check out, and if you right click then "Inspect Element", go to Console Log, then you will see what will be said in there.
- Colour Changer: Unfortunately, I did not have time to make my website change the colour, due to a big amount of time wasted on making the conditional requirement fancy.
- Form: I have a forms.js file embedded and they're used in the contact.html where you can test out all the cases and required questions.
